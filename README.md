# React-Express-SSR Template

This is a simple template based on [create-vite-extra](https://github.com/bluwy/create-vite-extra) `ssr-react-swc-ts` template. The only difference is that this template uses typescript for the server code.
And accordingly, the code is structured slightly different.

Feel free to use it as a starting point for your project.
